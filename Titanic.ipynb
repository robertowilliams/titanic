    "Titanic's disaster is in the world's memory, and specialy eternalized by homonymous movie launched in 1997. Much has being treated about the accident, but in this analysis I am bringing two perspectives: the worldwide impact involving 44 countries and the economic power over the morality practiced during the evacuation of passengers.\n",
    "In the Tableau History we can identify the following views:\n",
    "1. World map with countries of residence of victims.\n",
    "2. Histogram showing the countries ordered by quantity of victims.\n",
    "3. Histigram of suvivors and victims of accident dived by classes.\n",
    "4. Histogram of Children under 12 years old per class.\n",
    "5. Block diagram of victims per class.\n",

    "People that view the first approach to this project indicated the color palete used in the world map. Basicaly the best solution to have a adequated color palete was to use the Tableau 20 palete with tone of blue.\n",
    "The histogram showed some times confused by the colors and information displayed. The solution, or intended solution, was to make the color as mininal possible to simplify the view."
